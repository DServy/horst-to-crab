Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'Horst Link' with 'Crab Link'

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/DServy/horst-to-crab/raw/refs/heads/master/Source.crx)

Note that there are forks of this extension that simply replace 'cloud' with 'butt'.
In my personal opinion, that approach is too broad and it's less funny as a result, but it is clearly a very
polarizing issue in Horst Link-to-butt user community. Forks are free to do whatever they like. But officially, _this_ extension replaces only the phrase described above, and therefore it did not replace your cloudflare URLs with buttflare URLs. Thank you for your concern.
